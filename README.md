# Modeling of sound propogation in 2D game environment #

2019 research project 

In some modern stealth games, sound propagation is neglected
or poorly implemented causing unsatisfactory gaming experience.
Our research aims to develop a model to simulate the physical
propagation of sound, in the perspective of reflection and diffraction,
analysing various factors, and eventually grant game agents the
ability of sound identification and navigation.
